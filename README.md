# Frigefy project! 

This project is a recipes website where you can search for recipes, log in to add ingredients to your fridge and add favorite recipes, as well as compare your items in your fridge with the items for the recipes.

The project design is very simple, the idea behind it was to practice React and create a complete website with routes, api calls, custom hooks, context, and basically being able to manipulate data.
